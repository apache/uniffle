/**
 * Local allocation buffer.
 *
 * <p>The LAB is basically a bump-the-pointer allocator that allocates big (100K) chunks from and
 * then doles it out to threads that request slices into the array. These chunks can get pooled as
 * well. See {@link ChunkCreator}.
 *
 * <p>The purpose of this is to combat heap fragmentation in the shuffle server. By ensuring that
 * all blocks in a given partition refer only to large chunks of contiguous memory, we ensure that
 * large blocks get freed up when the partition is flushed.
 *
 * <p>Without the LAB, the byte array allocated during insertion end up interleaved throughout the
 * heap, and the old generation gets progressively more fragmented until a stop-the-world compacting
 * collection occurs.
 *
 * <p>This manages the large sized chunks. When blocks are to be added to partition, LAB's {@link
 * #tryCopyBlockToChunk(ShufflePartitionedBlock)} gets called. This allocates enough size in the
 * chunk to hold this block's data and copies into this area and then recreate a
 * LABShufflePartitionedBlock over this copied data.
 *
 * <p>
